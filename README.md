## Summary
Since 2013 I have played a key part in developing many small and big scale iOS apps working for both small startups and well-established corporations, I consider myself to be a valuable part of any mobile development team.
My primary focus is client satisfaction. I treat code as a means to reach that goal. I have experience working closely with testers, designers, product owners and business analysts, gathering requirements and making sure all the edge cases are covered. I make it my goal to create simple and easily maintainable code, remembering that code is wrote once but read many times. I always strive to cover most of my code with unit tests. Peer-review is of utmost importance to me, ensuring knowledge-sharing and revealing bugs and tech debt as early as possible.
